        This pattern is common. A requested operation either produces a result or doesnâ€™t,
        and you want to send different messages in response. As Option has subtypes None
        and Some, Either has subtypes Left and Right. The convention is to use Right
        to represent default values and Left to represent failures, so None usually is
        mapped to Left.
